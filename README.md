# Consensys-Final-Project

This is my final project for the consensys developer program 2018. The initiative behind joining the program was to understand more about the Ethereum blockchain and how decentralised applications are built.  


 ## What is the project ?

The solidity files in this project relate to that of a supply-chain or logistics company whereby each package or item being processed by the application will have its own unique token. Each entity looking to use the application can create an account, add members(fellow workers) to the account. Once an account is created the companys can then create the packages and sign them at intervals throughout its phases of distrubution.
